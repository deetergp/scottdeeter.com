We use Jenkins continuous integration at Classic to run a battery of tests against our repos. One such test is <code>drush coder</code> which, when it it passes, is great. But when <code>drush coder --minor</code> finds a problem, it ends up causing Drush to terminate abnormally and throw an error that says as much.</p></div></div></div>
