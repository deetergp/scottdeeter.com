title: Worldwide Meteor Day
summary: The Meteor framework goes 1.0 this week and we are having a party!
---

This week was a big one for the [Meteor](http://meteor.com) development platform, with the much-anticipated 1.0 release
going live. Next week will be big, too! Thursday, November 6, is Worldwide Meteor Day! Meteor Charlotte will be marking
the occasion with a special meetup.

We will be getting together at Packard Place in Uptown Charlotte. Doors will open at 6:30 PM with pizza and beer
provided by [XORCODE](http://xorcode.com) and [Classic Graphics](http://knowclassic.com). There will be an
*Introduction to Meteor* presentation at 7:00 and a deploy-fest immediately thereafter. Members will be available to
assist those who need a hand getting Meteor up and running on their machines. At 8:00, there will be a live video chat
with developers from the Meteor Development Group, the core team that developed the framework, along with meetup groups
from around the world. Aftwards, anyone who wants to will have an opportunity to show off any of the neat things they
have built with the platform. We will close out the night with more socializing, coworking and some hacking.

For those not familiar with Meteor, its creators describe it as "[â€¦] a complete open source platform for building web
and mobile apps in pure JavaScript." If you are a developer looking to find out what's next in web & mobile, come out
to Worldwide Meteor Day and see what all the fuss is about. And if you are a beginner looking to learn how to develop
for the web, Meteor is a great place to start. Even though 1.0 not even a week old, Meteor has been around for a couple
years now, and there are already a ton of great resources available to help you get started. Meteor Day will be a fun
way to get your feet wet.

Hope to see you there!
