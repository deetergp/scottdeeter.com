I smoked. How I got started isn't entirely clear, but it's probably as mundane as thinking it made me look cool. But when I got older and entered the work force, it became something different. It gave me an opportunity to step out of context at different points throughout the day. Whatever I was doing, my addiction would give me an excuse to step out and give me time to think.</p></div></div></div>
