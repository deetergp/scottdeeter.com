At any given point, when pressed, I can rattle off a laundry-list of motorcycles that I lust after. Being a rider of
modest means, I find that most of them are far too specialized to be suitable as my one-and-only motorcycle. As a
result, the bikes I actually buy tend to be good all-rounders, but compromised.

A Ural sidehack has aways been near the top of my *Dream Second Bike* list. With the new Gear-Up, they have gone up a
notch or two in the standings. It may very well be the perfect bike for hauling the kids to school, grocery-getting,
r the odd zombie apocalypse.

It's interesting that more and more motorcycle-related reviews are showing up on Wired.
