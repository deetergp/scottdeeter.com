title: Getting to Know Meteor
summary: Slides and a summary of the Intro to Meteor talk I gave at FOSS Charlotte.
---

I was fortunate to have the opportunity to give an introductory talk on the Meteor.js framework at this past
Wednesday's [FOSS Charlotte Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/FOSS-Charlotte/). There were about eight people in
attendance, all interested in learning more about what Meteor has to offer. In the talk, I covered an overview of what
Meteor is and what guiding principles its creators used, and continue to use, in it's ongoing development. I also gave
a live demo based on a talk [Naomi Seyfer gave at the Meteor HQ](http://youtu.be/lSAKFkxq4jA) from the the [meteor.com
"learn" page](https://www.meteor.com/learn-meteor).

In addition to using the *questions* app from the video, I took the liberty of posting the code to a
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/deetergp/questions) with some inline comments and a few improvements I picked up from
reading Tom Coleman and Sacha Greif's hugely informative [Discover Meteor](http://discovermeteor.com) book.

We did not record the presentation, but the [slide deck](https://speakerdeck.com/deetergp/getting-to-know-meteor-dot-js)
is available.

I am really looking forward to getting to lead Charlotte's first Meteor.js hackathon at our newly-formed
[Meteor Charlotte Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Meteor-Charlotte/). If you are going to be in town on Monday,
April 7th, please consider stopping by Packard Place in Uptown Charlotte to join in the fun!
