<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>I was fortunate to have the opportunity to give an introductory talk on the Meteor.js framework at this past Wednesday's <a href="http://www.meetup.com/FOSS-Charlotte/">FOSS Charlotte Meetup</a>. There were about eight people in attendance, all interested in learning more about what Meteor has to offer. In the talk, I covered an overview of what Meteor is and what guiding principles its creators used, and continue to use, in it's ongoing development.</p></div></div></div>
