title: SimpleTest and Distros

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>A large amount of the Drupal work we do at <a href="http://knowclassic.com">Classic Graphics</a> is based on distributions and install profiles, which helps speed up a lot of the work we do by making it easier to manage updates and by having some uniformity across our various projects. But it recently threw me for a loop when trying to write SimpleTests for one of our projects. I could not seem to get the test case to enable any modules at all, in spite of the fact that I had used the same syntax to enable modules for testing on other Drupal sites.</p></div></div></div>
