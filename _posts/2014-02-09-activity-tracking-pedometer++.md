title: Activity Tracking & Pedometer++
summary: My thoughts on David Smith's excellent Pedometer++ app. (I like it!)
---

This is old news for people that follow [Marco Arment's blog](http://marco.org), but I just happened upon it today
and found it interesting. It's an article from David Smith, the developer of the
[Pedometer++](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pedometer++/id712286167?mt=8) iOS app. I had been eyeing activity
trackers for quite a while, but never pulled the trigger. No matter what whiz-bang feature came out on the
latest-greatest offerings from Nike, Jawbone, or FitBit, I could never quite convince myself to spend the dough. On
more than one occasion, I tried using [Moves](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moves/id509204969?mt=8) on my iPhone 5.
But it usually a matter of days before I uninstalled it, owing largely to the fact that most of the walking I ended up
doing was between places I could charge my phone.

When Apple announced the M7 motion co-processor (and the iPhone 5s), I took notice, but not action. It took reading
the MacStories
[Must Have iPhone Apps 2013 Edition](http://www.macstories.net/roundups/my-must-have-iphone-apps-2013-edition/)
hitting the virtual stands. When I read Pedometer++ "*doesnâ€™t eat battery life like an Italian family at Christmas
dinner"*, I knew it was time to snag myself a 5s.

Weeks later, Smith's app is still one of a small handful that get opened daily. More often than not, I am met with
guilt upon the realization that I've walked far fewer steps than my goal, but I am happy to have that knowledge
nonetheless.
