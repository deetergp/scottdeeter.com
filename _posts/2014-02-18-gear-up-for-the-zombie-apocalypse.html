<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even" property="content:encoded"><p>At any given point, when pressed, I can rattle off a laundry-list of motorcycles that I lust after. Being a rider of modest means, I find that most of them are far too specialized to be suitable as my one-and-only motorcycle. As a result, the bikes I actually buy tend to be good all-rounders, but compromised.</p>

<p>A Ural sidehack has aways been near the top of my <em>Dream Second Bike</em> list. With the new Gear-Up, they have gone up a notch or two in the standings. It may very well be the perfect bike for hauling the kids to school, grocery-getting, or the odd zombie apocalypse.</p></div></div></div>
