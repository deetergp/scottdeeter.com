# Hi there!

I'm Scott. Most folks call me Deeter. I am a father, husband, and computer programmer, currently residing in North Carolina with my talented wife, Alissa, and three amazing daughters. I am a regular runner and bicyclist and an occasional motorcyclist, musician, and blogger. For the last several years, I have worked at [Classic Graphics](http://knowclassic.com), an award-winning graphic communications company, as a software developer, building custom marketing applications with the Drupal framework. I got my start working with Drupal while working at UNCC and participating in the [Charlotte Drupal User Group](https://www.meetup.com/charDUG/), which I now co-organize.
